Previous research shows that emotion-inducing prompts can elevate “anxiety” in LLMs, affecting behavior and amplifying biases. Here, we found that traumatic narratives increased Chat-GPT-4’s reported anxiety while mindfulness-based exercises reduced it, though not to baseline. These findings suggest managing LLMs’ “emotional states” can foster safer and more ethical human-AI interactions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computer Simulation Languages; Social Psychology; Emotional State; Language Model; Mental Health; State-anxiety; Anxiety Disorder; Army; Article; Chatgpt; Controlled Study; Emotion; Human; Large Language Model; Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction; Natural Disaster; Relaxation Training; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; Traffic Accident; Violence","Computer simulation languages; Social psychology; Emotional state; Language model; Mental health; State-anxiety; anxiety disorder; army; Article; ChatGPT; controlled study; emotion; human; large language model; mindfulness-based stress reduction; natural disaster; relaxation training; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; traffic accident; violence","English","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000059115"
